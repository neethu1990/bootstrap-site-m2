                 <h1>JAVA</h1>

        <h2>A programming language</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Java</strong> is a <em>, class-based, object-oriented</em> programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
        </p>

        <p>Java was originally developed by <strong>James Gosling</strong> at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. </p>
        
        <p style="background-color: aqua;">There are five principle goals in the creation of Java language </p>
        <ol>
            <li>It must be simple, <em>object-oriented</em> and familiar.</li>
            <li>It must be <em>robust</em> and secure.</li>
            <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
            <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
            <li>It must be <em>interpreted,threaded</em>,and<em> dynamic</em></li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>As of September 2021, Java 8,11 and 17 are supported as Long-term Support(LTS) versions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updayes for personal use indefinitely.Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 18 and 8,11 and 17 that are still receiving security and other upgrades. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Sun has defined and supports four editiond of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java Card for smart-cards.</li>
            <li>Java Platform,Micro Edition (Java ME)- targeting environmrnts with limited resources.</li>
            <li>Java Platform,Enterprise Edition(Java EE)- targeting large distributed enterprise or internet environment.</li>
            <li>Java Platform,Standard Edition(Java SE)- targeting workstation environments.</li><br>
            <p>The classes in the Java APIs are organised into separate groups called <em>packages</em>. Each package contains a set of related interfaces, classes, subpackages and exceptions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sun also provided an edition called Personal Java that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME configuration-profile pairings.</p>
        </ul>
